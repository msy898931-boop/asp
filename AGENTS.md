# AGENTS.md

Repository-specific knowledge for the ASTRA desktop app (project AURA) fork.

## What this repo is

A **private working copy** of the public upstream `alimazna/asp` (C++ ASTRA/AURA
gold decision-support desktop app). Upstream is **read-only for us**: we only
clone/fetch from it, never push. All our work lives on `main` here.

- Upstream: `https://github.com/alimazna/asp` (public, ~365 commits, active)
- Our repo: `https://github.com/msy898931-boop/asp` (private)
- Our `main` = upstream `main` + our Telegram bot. To resync, fetch upstream and
  rebase/cherry-pick our additions on top (they touch disjoint files today).

## Layout

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/` | C++ backend (API, runtime, health, governance, telegram gateway) |
| `frontend/qt/` | Qt 6 desktop UI (the ASTRA window) |
| `bridge/mt5_python/` | Loopback JSON bridge to MetaTrader 5 (Python stdlib) |
| `bridge/telegram_bot/` | **Our** Telegram operator bot (Python stdlib) |
| `scripts/bundle.py` | Stages the installable bundle from `packaging/bundle_manifest.json` |
| `src/platform/windows/` | Backend host, path resolution, process supervision |

## Build & test (backend)

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build -j$(nproc)
cd build && ctest          # 19 tests
```

Frontend is Linux/Qt and Windows-only for the packaged `.exe`.

## Telegram bot

`bridge/telegram_bot/` reads the frontend-facing loopback API
(`127.0.0.1:8790/api/v1`) — it never touches runtime internals.

```bash
# backend must run first
export TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=...   # @BotFather token
export TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=...     # default chat to notify
./bridge/telegram_bot/run_bot.sh          # backend + bot together
python3 -m unittest discover -s bridge/telegram_bot   # 18 tests
```

`aura_backend_host` launches the bot as a **supervised sidecar** automatically
when `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` is set (mirroring how it launches the MT5 bridge).
Absence of a token is not an error.

Commands: `/status` `/health` `/analysis` `/signal` `/bridge` `/subscribe`
`/unsubscribe` `/help`. Push alerts fire on health/bridge/new-signal
transitions (first reading is primed silently).

## Windows .exe

`.github/workflows/build-windows.yml` builds `frontend/qt` on `windows-latest`
(Qt 6.8.3 + MSVC), runs `windeployqt`, and uploads an `ASTRA-windows` artifact.
It triggers on pushes that touch `frontend/qt/**`, or manually
(`workflow_dispatch`). It builds the **frontend only** — the backend/MT5 bridge
are separate and not bundled by this workflow.

```bash
gh run download --repo msy898931-boop/asp -n ASTRA-windows   # or via API
```

## Notes / gotchas

- The backend build is self-contained; the MT5 bridge is loopback-only by design.
- `HttpClient` in `src/foundation/` deliberately refuses non-loopback hosts, so
  it cannot reach Telegram's HTTPS API — that is why the bot is Python, not C++.
- Telemetry-style posture: everything is shadow-mode; nothing carries execution
  authority, and messages always carry a "not financial advice" disclaimer.
- Re-staging the bundle: `python3 scripts/bundle.py --out dist/ASTRA
  --backend-host build/aura_backend_host` then `--verify`. It prunes
  `__pycache__`/`.pyc` automatically.

## Always-on server (Docker)

For a 24/7 bot (no PC needed) the repo ships a headless image: backend host +
MT5 bridge + Telegram bot, no desktop UI.

```bash
cp .env.example .env      # set TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN + TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID
docker compose up -d --build
docker compose logs -f    # expect: "ASTRA bot online ... subscribers=1"
```

`docker-compose.yml` sets `restart: unless-stopped` and publishes the API on
loopback only. Subscribers persist in the `astra-state` volume. Deploy on any
small VPS: install Docker, `git clone`, fill `.env`, `docker compose up -d`.

Notes: the container must reach `api.telegram.org` (default egress is fine);
the API port is loopback-published and never exposed publicly.

### Synthetic data source

Without a Windows terminal the bridge reports MT5 as unavailable and the system
stays DEGRADED (honest, by design). To exercise the whole pipeline anyway, the
bridge accepts a **replay** source that serves the committed XAUUSD M1 corpus
through the same closed-bar contract:

```bash
ASTRA_DATA_SOURCE=replay \
ASTRA_REPLAY_CSV=/app/research/data/xauusd_m1/xauusd_m1_real.csv
```

`bridge/mt5_python/replay_client.py` implements it; the bridge reports
`broker = "REPLAY (synthetic)"`, so the source is never mistaken for a live
broker. Default remains `mt5`. This is a development/demo feed, not market data.

### Mobile app (PWA)

`mobile/` is an installable phone app (no store, no build step): an
instrument-panel shell that reads the same loopback API through its own origin.
`mobile/serve_mobile.py` serves the shell and reverse-proxies `/api/v1/*` and
`/bridge/*` to 127.0.0.1 (GET only, upstream fixed to loopback). Run it on a
public port; icons are generated with `mobile/icons/make_icons.py` (stdlib only).
Install on the phone via the browser's "Add to Home screen".

### Android APK

`android/` wraps the same web app in a WebView shell to produce a real,
installable `.apk` (see `android/README.md`). The build is Gradle-free: a JDK
and Android SDK build-tools suffice. The server URL is baked at build time and
can be changed on the device from the app's error screen.
